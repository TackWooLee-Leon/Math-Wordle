# Math Wordle
Math Wordle is a math puzzle game inspired by the classic word game, Wordle. In the game, players aim to use digits and basic operators to create an identical mathematical equation that the application has generated, the only hint you have is the target number. Players have a limited number of attempts to solve the puzzle, and each guess provides feedback on how close the equation is to the generated equation, helping players refine their guesses.

# Why I Made This
I created the Math Wordle project to add a fun math twist to the classic Wordle game. It was a great way for me to build something interactive that helps people practice math, while also improving my coding skills.

# How I Made This
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the Math Wordle project. HTML and CSS handled the layout and styling, while JavaScript took care of the logic. JavaScript manages event handlers so that when users click buttons, the corresponding numbers or operators appear on the grid. It also processes user input: clicking "delete" or "enter" submits the calculation. Additionally, JavaScript provides feedback by turning background color of grids depending if the input is either at the correct position, at the wrong position, or doesn't exist in the generated equation.
